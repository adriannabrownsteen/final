I take courses like figure drawing and digital media to advance and expirement with my different talents. when im not drawing i enjoy taking photographs, going on adventures, and driving around. im always on the run and id rather be out exploring than sitting at home. I am currently interested in industrial design and plan to pursue a future focused around this career. I really take an interest in things involving design, from car design, all the way to interior design. Welcome to my website! </p></div>
